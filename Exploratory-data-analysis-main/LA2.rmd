EDA LA - 2 "Pokemon Dataset" Group 12: Aman Aftab (1NT20IS016), Sumanth Kamath (1NT20IS172)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#The provided commands load several libraries (tidyverse, ggplot2, ggthemes, GGally, plotrix) to access various functions and utilities for data manipulation and visualization in R. Additionally, they read a CSV file named "pokemon.csv" from the specified file path ("C:/EDA/pokemon.csv") and store the data in the pokemon variable.
```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(GGally)
library(plotrix)
pokemon <- read.csv("C:/EDA/pokemon.csv")
```

#The provided R commands utilize the "pokemon" dataset to create visualizations that explore different aspects of the data. These commands generate plots to understand the distribution of Pokémon types, compare attack and defense attributes, examine base experience by type, visualize the speed distribution, and analyze Pokémon generations.

#The first command groups the dataset by "type1" and creates a bar plot to display the count of Pokémon for each type. It provides an overview of the Pokémon types present in the dataset.

#The second command generates a scatter plot to compare the "attack" and "defense" attributes of Pokémon. It helps identify any potential relationships or patterns between these attributes.

#The third command produces a boxplot that illustrates the distribution of base experience across Pokémon types. It allows for comparisons of base experience between different types.

#The fourth command creates a histogram to visualize the distribution of Pokémon speeds. It provides insights into the frequency and range of speed values among the Pokémon in the dataset.

#The fifth command groups the dataset by "generation" and creates a bar plot to display the count of Pokémon for each generation. It helps understand the distribution of Pokémon across different generations.

#The first command groups the dataset by "type2" and creates a polar bar plot to represent the count of Pokémon for each type. The angle of each sector corresponds to the count, providing a visual representation of the distribution of Pokémon types in the "type2" category.

#The second command groups the dataset by both "generation" and "type1" and creates a stacked bar plot to showcase the count of Pokémon for each combination. It provides insights into the distribution of Pokémon types across different generations.

#The third command generates a line plot to visualize the capture rate of Pokémon across different generations. It helps identify any trends or patterns in capture rates over time.

#The fourth command creates a density plot to examine the distribution of Pokémon HP values based on their legendary status. It allows for a comparison of HP distributions between legendary and non-legendary Pokémon.

#The fifth command calculates the correlation matrix for a subset of attributes (HP, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, and speed) from the "pokemon" dataset.
